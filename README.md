# Rating Prediction with MAMBA, GPT-2, and NCF

This project compares different models for rating prediction tasks in recommendation systems, including MAMBA (a state-space model), GPT-2 (a transformer-based model), and the traditional Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model in classification setting. The focus is on evaluating these models' accuracy and efficiency in both training and inference, with experiments conducted on popular datasets like **MovieLens100k**, **MovieLens1M**, and **Food Reviews**.

## Key Features:
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate the performance of MAMBA, GPT-2, and NCF on rating prediction tasks.
- **Efficiency Assessment**: Analyze training time, inference time, and scalability across different dataset sizes.
- **State-of-the-art Performance**: MAMBA models consistently outperform baseline models in terms of accuracy and speed.
- **Dataset Support**: Use popular recommendation system datasets such as MovieLens and Food Reviews for training and evaluation.
